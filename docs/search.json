    "text": "Welcome\nThis is the website for the “Geographic Data Science” module ENVS363/563 at the University of Liverpool. This is course designed and delivered by Dr. Elisabetta Pietrostefani and Dr. Carmen Cabrera-Arnau from the Geographic Data Science Lab at the University of Liverpool, United Kingdom. Much of the course material is inspired by Dani Arribas-Bel’s course on Geographic Data Science. The previous version of this course is available here.\nThis module will introduce students to the field of Geographic Data Science (GDS), a discipline established at the intersection between Geographic Information Science (GIS) and Data Science. The course covers how the modern GIS toolkit can be integrated with Data Science tools to solve practical real-world problems.\nCore to the set of employable skills to be taught in this course is an introduction to programming tools. Students will be able to whether to develop their skills in either R or Python in Lab sessions.\nThe website is free to use and is licensed under the Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International.

Students will complete an essay which combines both code, data visualisation and prose supported by references in order to demonstrate sound understanding of all learning outcomes.\n\nFull Assignment details to come\n\nImportant information about data access through the US Census API:\n\nIn R: ENVS2425-363-563.2.qmd\nIn Python: ENVS2425-363-563.2.ipynb\n\nOverview\nHere’s the premise. You will take the role of a real-world geographic data scientist tasked to explore datasets on Los Angeles and find useful insights for a variety of city decision-makers. It does not matter if you have never been to the Los Angeles. In fact, this will help you focus on what you can learn about the city through the data, without the influence of prior knowledge. Furthermore, the assessment will not be marked based on how much you know about Los Angeles but instead about how much you can show you have learned through analysing data. You will need contextualise your project by highlighting the opportunities and limitations of ‘old’ and ‘new’ forms of spatial data and reference relevant literature.\nWhat is a Computational Essay?\nA computational essay is an essay whose narrative is supported by code and computational results that are included in the essay itself. This piece of assessment is equivalent to 4,000 word. However, this is the overall weight. Since you will need to create not only narrative but also code and figures, here are the requirements:\n\nMaximum of 1,000 words of ordinary text (references do not contribute to the word count). You should answer the specified questions within the narrative. The questions should be included within a wider analysis.\nUp to four maps or figures (a figure may include more than one map and will only count as one but needs to be integrated in the same overall output)\nUp to one table\n\nThere are three kinds of elements in a computational essay:\n\nOrdinary text (in English)\nComputer input (R or Python)\nComputer output\n\nThese three elements all work together to express what’s being communicated.",

There is some documentation explaining its logic.\n40-49: the code runs and produces the expected output. There is some documentation explaining its logic.\n50-59: the code runs and produces the expected output. There is extensive documentation explaining its logic.\n60-69: the code runs and produces the expected output. There is extensive documentation, properly formatted, explaining its logic.\n70-79: all as above, plus the code design includes clear evidence of skills presented in advanced sections of the course (e.g. custom methods, list comprehensions, etc.).\n80-100: all as above, plus the code contains novel contributions that extend/improve the functionality the student was provided with (e.g. algorithm optimizations, novel methods to perform the task, etc.).",
